                      <li>All players must place their cheese on the BBQ at the same time.</li>
                      <li class="alternate-li">Cheeses must not overlap.</li>
                      <li>After the initial throwing of the cheese onto the barbecue (the "cast"), one poke of the slice (the "poke") is permitted in cases of accidental overlap when the offending cheeses must be repositioned as quickly as possible. No further touching of the cheese is permitted.</li> 
                      <li class="alternate-li">No blowing/fanning the flames under your cheese.</li>
                      <li>The winning cheese is defined as the one whose reaches a fully inflated stage first. Fully inflated means that all four corners have raised off the BBQ and the plastic is taut (distinctive "stretch" marks appear on the sides of the parcel). This state must be maintainable, it does not count if the bag is pulsing up and down due to springing a leak.</li>

                      <li class="alternate-li">Note that springing a leak does not automatically mean you have lost - it is possible for the hole to become sealed with melted cheese and the bag to fully inflate anyway - such is the excitement of cheese racing - it's not over till it's over!</li>

                      <li>In the event of a draw. The tied cheese owners will race again.</li>

                      <li class="alternate-li">Deliberate breaking of any of these rules will result in your cheese being disqualified and removed from the BBQ.</li>

      <p>WARNING!! Cheese racing can be dangerous - the makers of this website can not be held responsible for any accidents or injuries that may occur. Practice safe cheese racing by following these simple guide lines.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Do NOT attempt 'indoor cheese racing'. This is strictly an outdoor sport. (This includes tents!)</li>

    <li>Be sure to ingest large quantities of alcohol and/or other chemical relaxant before (and during) play. This will relax the body and nervous system, thus minimising the pain of any injury and enabling you to play on.</li>
</ul>
    <p>Having said that, the sport does have an impressive safety record with zero fatalities, so far...</p>

    <p class="anno bold">
          * Opinions vary as to whether this is really a waste. Opinions also
          vary as to whether any actual cheese is involved.
